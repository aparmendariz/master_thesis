# Detecting Collusive Behavior Using an Ensemble Method

## Overview

This repository contains the code and data for my master thesis on detecting collusive behavior across different countries and industries using an ensemble method. The study integrates six algorithms based on statistical screens of bid or price distributions to identify collusion.

## Highlights

- **Objective:** Evaluate the effectiveness of an ensemble method in detecting collusive behavior in various datasets.
- **Data:** Five datasets from proven cartel cases across Brazil, Italy, Japan, and Switzerland, plus a combined dataset.
- **Methodology:** Applied an ensemble method and a rotating scheme to test the transferability across different domains.
- **Results:**
  - **Country and Industry-Level:** Correct classification rates of 74% to 88%.
  - **Combined Data Set:** Achieved a 76% accuracy, increasing to 80% with a balanced dataset.
  - **Challenges:** Difficulty in generalizing the model when trained on combined data and tested on unseen country or industry data.
  
## Conclusion

The ensemble method shows promise for detecting collusive behavior, but further research is needed to enhance its general applicability across diverse industries and countries.
